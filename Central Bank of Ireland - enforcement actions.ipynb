    "#### Function to scrape enforcement actions by the Central Bank of Ireland.\n",
    "The actual target URL is not listed below. The target webpage currently contains 13 pages of enforcement actions. Apart from the last page, each page has 10 embedded links. Each link contains information on an enforcement action or settlement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main function below focuses on the script within each link and extracts only entities of interest that were subject to the enforcement action. There is a lot of java script embedded in the url which is more the domain of \"Selenium\" but the target information was text within a script class so it was possible to stick with Requests and Beautiful soup to extract the text information of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Python function of interest below is:  get_enforcement_list(). get_enforcement_list()  uses the following Python libraries: \n",
    "1. Python Requests to extract all html, css from target URL. (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)\n",
    "2. Python Beautiful Soup parses the html, css and text from java script. (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)\n",
    "3. \"spaCy\" utilises its NER models to search for any named entities in the target list that are potentially of interest. (https://spacy.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once called the function produces a list of organisations or persons that were subject to an enforcement or settlement action. All names are publicly available at time of scrape. Run time was just under four seconds for the function to scrape the entire contents from the webpage, parse all scraped code, look through thirteen pages of interest and produce a list of organisations/people of interest. Overall the NER models worked well. There were a few misses which could be refined and cleaned up. Some entities were merged as one eg (regulator and target entity). The list is at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
